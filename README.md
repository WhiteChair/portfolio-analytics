## 🔒 Privacy First

**Your data never leaves your browser. Ever.**

### 100% Client-Side
- **No server** = no database = no way to see other users' data
- Each user's CSV **stays in their browser only**
- No data is ever uploaded anywhere
- LocalStorage is sandboxed per user/browser
- When you close the tab, your portfolio data is gone

### 🔑 API Key Security
If you choose to use the Claude API, your key is stored in `localStorage` which is:
- Only accessible by the same origin (this website's URL)
- Never sent to any server except Anthropic's API
- Never visible to other users
- You can reset it anytime with the "Reset Key" button

### No Tracking
- No analytics
- No cookies (except localStorage for your API key preference)
- No third-party scripts that could leak data
- **Open source** — inspect the code yourself

## 📁 Supported CSV Formats

Works with many common EU / neo-broker exports. The parser auto-detects delimiter (`,` / `;`), European vs US number formats (`1.234,56` and `1,234.56`), normalizes headers, and falls back gracefully when columns are missing. Missing ISINs are enriched from a built-in name map.

| Format | Typical columns / signals |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Deutsche Bank (raw)** | Pot, Assets, Instrument Name, ISIN, Mkt Val, Quantity, Pos Cur |
| **Deutsche Bank (simplified)** | Category, Product Name, Value (EUR), Currency, Quantity |
| **Interactive Brokers** | Symbol / ISIN, Quantity, Position Value, Currency, Asset Class (Open Positions / Flex) |
| **DEGIRO-style** | Product, ISIN, Quantity / Shares, Value |
| **Trade Republic / Scalable Capital style** | Name / Product, (ISIN), Quantity, Current Value / Value, Performance % |
| **Generic** | Any combination of Name/Product + (ISIN or Symbol) + Quantity + Value/Market Value + optional Currency |
